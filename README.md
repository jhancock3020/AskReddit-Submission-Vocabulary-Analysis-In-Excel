# AskReddit-Submission-Vocabulary-Analysis-In-Excel
It is a commonly held belief that the same questions are posted onto the subreddit AskReddit on a regular basis in order to gain the most 'karma' (upvotes), with the only major difference being how each question is phrased.
The goal of this project is to use Python 3 and the PRAW library to find the top 25 (front page) posts on AskReddit for a certain period of time.
During this time, the words used in each post will be counted in order to determine the most commonly used words and phrases.
The number of comments, upvotes, upvote ratio, if the submission is marked as NSFW or 'Serious', and awards earned (among possible other attributes) will also be tracked for each submission.
